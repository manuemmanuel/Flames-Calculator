FLAMES, an acronym for Friends, Lovers, Affectionate, Marriage, Enemies, and Siblings, is a fun and simple game enjoyed by many for exploring relationships. By writing two names and counting the remaining letters after removing common ones, you determine one of six outcomes: 
<br>
- F for friends, 
- L for lovers, 
- A for affection, 
- M for marriage, 
- E for enemies, and 
- S for siblings. 
However, it's just for fun and shouldn't be taken too seriously. The results are random and are a light-hearted way to spark curiosity and laughter when thinking about different kinds of connections between people.
